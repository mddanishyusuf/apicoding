Big Hosting companies like Heroku, Firebase giving free services because they want you to grow first. So, you can use their service at the start for free for your small scale projects or MVP.

I know some of the best and reliable tools for your Node.js API to host without any hassle. Here I'm listing them and will explain a little bit the process to do deploy there.

- Glitch
- Heroku
- Firebase Functions

## Glitch

Glitch is my go-to solution when I start to build my idea as an MVP because it's so easy to quickly set up API endpoints into the browser itself. everything into a single window.

#### What is Glitch offering?

- In-browser Developments
- unlimited projects
- 4000 requests/hour
- Every project will have 512MB RAM.
- 200mb disk storage(it's more than enough to build MVP)
- Sleep time is 5 minutes if your project is not used. So, to awake you can make HTTP call to `https://<projecy_name>.glitch.me`
- Custom Domain

## Heroku

Heroku is more developer-friendly and this is an all-in-one solution for all programming applications. Their server is well maintained and powerful.

## Firebase Functions

Firebase is an all-in-one solution for web developments because they have Authentication, Database, Storage, Hosting, Functions & ML kit. This is my best tool as a glitch. I'm using GitHub, Twitter & Email Password authentication into my all web applications.

So, you can also host your Node.js API as Firebase Functions with FIrebse CLI.

- Firebase CLI to deploy
- unlimited projects
- 2,000,000 requests/month
- Every project will have 1GB RAM with 1 GHz CPU.
- 5GB bandwidth
- Custom Domain
